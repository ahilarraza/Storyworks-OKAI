For our solution we presented OKAI that is a conversational AI avatar designed to make the first-contact experience with Innovate By Day feel more human and guided. Instead of a static form, the idea is that asks questions, gives simple explanations, and helps clients express what they need.  
The website promotes this idea by explaining the problem, showing the benefits, walking through how VAYN works, and giving a small preview of how an interactive experience could look.

* Challenges I Faced & How I Overcame Them 
My biggest challenge was keeping the layout consistent and responsive across all three pages. I solved this by organizing everything into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files, testing different breakpoints, and adjusting the grid and flex layouts until they worked smoothly. Another challenge was making the content feel clear without overwhelming the user, so I kept the sections short and visually structured.

* JavaScript Interactivity Added (Beyond Form Validation)
Besides validating the contact form, I added:
- A Read More / Read Less toggle on the homepage to expand additional content.
- A small ROI calculator on the Features page that estimates potential time savings (fictional).
These elements make the site feel more dynamic and help demonstrate how interactive the real VAYN experience could be.

* Deployment Platform & Why I Used It
I deployed the website using GitHub Pages because it’s easy to connect directly to my repository, updates automatically when I push new changes, and is simple to use for static projects like this one.
